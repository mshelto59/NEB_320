		<h1> History </h1>
			<p> Burlington Bikes has been a staple in the Vermont cycling community for over 60 years.
				Our dedication to exceptional customer service and quality bike repairs has landed us a place as one of the 
				Top 100 Bike Dealers in America.The Burlington Bikes family is as diverse as our customers, but we all love having fun on our bikes. Our goal is to make cycling a great experience for you. We do that by helping you get equipped with the right bike and accessories for your needs, and by repairing your bike right the first time so you can spend more time riding. <br> <br>
				
				Few businesses can claim 65 years of continuously successful operation and fewer still point to an unwavering dedication to the highest levels of customer service over that time but Burlington Bikes is one that can. Burlington Bikes Cyclery was founded in 1953 by Burlington Bikes Foley in Burlington Old North End on Archibald Street. The shop began as a humble bicycle and lawn mower repair shop, but quickly evolved into one of New England's largest Schwinn dealers. Several owners have guided the store’s growth since Burlington Bikes retired in the 1980’s, most recently by Roger Frey who brought it to Williston Road in South Burlington. <br> <br>

				Joe Drennan and Andrew Boczar, both longtime Burlington Bikes employees and managers, purchased the store in 2015 and are carrying on our tradition of giving you the best bicycle products and customer service at the best price.

				We’re on our fourth generation of customers now. It’s pretty great to have folks who bought their first bike from Burlington Bikes on Archibald Street come in and get two for their grandchildren. Bikes have changed a lot but not our commitment to the folks who ride them.

				Oh, and Burlington Bikes? 96 years old and still proud of what he built.

				 After many years…
				 Burlington Bikes has relocated to our new home of 2069 Williston Rd., South Burlington!

				 With over 12,000 sq ft. our new location allows us to have more inventory and an expansive Service Area to help you find the perfect bike, or get you back to riding!
